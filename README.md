# basic-scientific-calculator-in-java-
I have made a very basic scientific calculator in java 

You can copy the whole calculator.java and then open intellij or any platform you want, where you write your java code. 
Then just paste this and you are good to go. Run it and enjoy. 

This program is free to use for anything. This is a royalty free program.
